VERY WIP - UNTESTED MODULE

Smooth fake scroll using CSS transform.
A CommonJS fork of Bartek Drozdz VirtualScroll utility (see his [article](http://www.everyday3d.com/blog/index.php/2014/08/18/smooth-scrolling-with-virtualscroll/)).

Mostly to make it easier to install, but also because I have a few ideas I would like to implement later.

## Todo
- tests
- use a prototype instead of a singleton object ?
- keys options (bind other keys)
- maybe using defaults and tiny-emitter is overkill
